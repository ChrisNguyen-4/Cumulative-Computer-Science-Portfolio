### Description
The Housing Price Prediction project on Kaggle assisted me in developing and applying tools for machine learning that in this case was used to predict the cost of a house based on its features. 
Specific tools that were utilized for the project include but not limited to Python, Pandas, feature engineering, pipelines, imputation, and one-hot encoding.
If you are interested, version 29 represents my best version of the model.
